# Watchlist Splitter
Recently, TradingView has imposed a limitation on the number of stocks we can add, and the current limit is 30. To address this limitation, I have created a simple tool that scans an Excel file exported from chartink.com and splits it into batches of 30. in this way you can add all batches one by one and scan stocks
